# Azure DevOps Deployments
Azure DevOps is a CI/CD platform to help you deploy to Azure, with not a lot changing from the 2020 MSA tutorial. You can find the deployment guide [here](https://github.com/NZMSA/2020-Phase-1/blob/master/DevOps%20-%20Azure%20Pipeline/README.md).

>NB Microsoft are no longer giving away free agents, so you will need to self host :)
