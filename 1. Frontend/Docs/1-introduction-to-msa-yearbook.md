# Introduction

The following workshop aims to introduce you to creating a react with typescript application that integrates with your GraphQL API that you've created in the back-end section. We will be building a simple front end web app for displaying student repos. We will be going through the following basic requirements from the assignment:

- Create a new React + TypeScript web app.
- Use a UI library/styled components.
- Responsive UI (Web app displays “nicely” on both computers and mobile)
- Use Apollo Client to connect to your backend.
- Deploy frontend using GitHub actions to deploy to Azure.

### Advance Requirement Resources (optional):

We encourage all students to have a go at integrating these libraries and frameworks that really make your website come to life! We will be going through React Router and Storybook in the workshop but the rest is up to you! Let your creativity run wild!

- Integrate compnents using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
- Unit testing components with [Jest testing framework](https://jestjs.io/docs/tutorial-react)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) to handle navigation among the views of various components in your web app.
- Creation and usage of custom branding that is integrated into the product e.g. custom logo’s, theming, dark mode toggle
